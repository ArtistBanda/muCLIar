# muCLIar

Coffee, Music and Code! What else could we developers ask for?

But then, long gone are days of slow internet and locally stored songs. **muCLIar** offers you a command line utility that lets you play the song you wish to listen to, directly through **YoutTube** servers. **muCLIar** lets you login and hence plays your "similar song" playlist as well.
